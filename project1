 The data flow diagram shows Hamps Crafts’ current purchase and supply process for their brick and mortar store. The process begins with a customer placing their order which will then be processed through the secure local merchant account. Transaction funds are collected then transferred to the company’s primary business account within 2 business days. Inventory specialists and the order fulfillment team use a local database to input information related to the order status and tracking of shipments.

Integration Approach:
I would recommend incorporating elements of the online storefront into the current process model. This approach leverages existing processes and databases, ensuring a seamless integration of the online storefront with the brick and mortar operations. By extending the current system, it reduces complexity and allows for efficient management of both online and in store sales. The integration should be designed to provide a unified view of inventory and order processing, streamlining operations and enhancing customer experience.
